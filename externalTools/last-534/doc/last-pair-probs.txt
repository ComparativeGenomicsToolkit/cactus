last-pair-probs
===============

This program reads candidate alignments of paired DNA reads to a
genome, and:

1. estimates the distribution of distances between paired reads,
2. estimates the probability that each alignment represents the
   genomic source of the read.

"Paired" means that the reads come from either end of a DNA fragment,
in tail-to-tail orientation::

  5' ---------->................................. 3'
  3' .................................<---------- 5'

Or head-to-head orientation::

  5' .................................----------> 3'
  3' <----------................................. 5'

The program writes the alignments with "mismap" probabilities,
i.e. the probability that the alignment does not represent the genomic
source of the read. By default, it discards alignments with mismap
probability > 0.01.

Simple usage
------------

Suppose we have paired DNA reads in a file called "interleaved.fastq"
(in fastq-sanger format), where the first two reads are paired, the
next two reads are paired, and so on.  We can align them to the human
genome like this::

  lastdb -m1111110 hg human-genome.fasta
  lastal -Q1 -e120 -i1 hg interleaved.fastq > temp.maf
  last-pair-probs temp.maf > out.maf

Suppose we have paired reads in two files, where the two first reads
are paired, the two second reads are paired, and so on.  We can
interleave them like this::

  fastq-interleave x.fastq y.fastq | lastal -Q1 -e120 -i1 hg > temp.maf

Reads from potentially-spliced RNA molecules
--------------------------------------------

Use the -r option::

  last-pair-probs -r temp.maf > out.maf

Without -r, it assumes the distances between paired reads follow a
normal distribution.  With -r, it assumes the distances follow a
skewed (log-normal) distribution, which is much more appropriate for
spliced RNA.

Efficient usage
---------------

The preceding recipes make a potentially-huge temp file, and
last-pair-probs reads it twice: first to estimate the distance
distribution, and then to estimate alignment probabilities.  It is
more efficient to estimate the distance distribution from a small
sample of the data::

  lastal -Q1 -e120 -i1 hg sample.fastq | last-pair-probs -e

Suppose this tells us that the mean distance is 250 and the standard
deviation is 38.5.  We can use that to estimate the alignment
probabilities::

  lastal -Q1 -e120 -i1 hg all.fastq | last-pair-probs -f250 -s38.5 > out.maf

Going faster by parallelization
-------------------------------

This will run the pipeline on all your CPU cores::

  fastq-interleave x.fastq y.fastq |
  parallel-fastq "lastal -Q1 -e120 -i1 hg | last-pair-probs -f250 -s38.5" > out.maf

It requires GNU parallel to be installed
(http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/).

Details
-------

* The "distance" between a pair of reads means the distance between
  their 5' ends.  Positive distance indicates tail-to-tail
  orientation, and negative distance indicates head-to-head
  orientation.  Negative distances are not considered when -r is used,
  nor for circular chromosomes.

* The program reads one batch of alignments at a time (by looking for
  lines starting with "# batch").  It assumes there is exactly one DNA
  read per batch: if it finds more than one, it will complain.  The
  lastal -i1 option ensures there is one query per batch.

* The alignments may be in either format produced by lastal (maf or
  tabular).  They must include header lines (of the kind produced by
  lastal) describing the alignment parameters.

* If a read name ends in neither "/1" nor "/2", the program appends
  "/1" if it is the 1st in a pair or "/2" if it is the 2nd.

* It is also possible to supply the alignments in two files::

    lastal -Q1 -e120 -i1 hg x.fastq > temp1.maf
    lastal -Q1 -e120 -i1 hg y.fastq > temp2.maf
    last-pair-probs temp1.maf temp2.maf > out.maf

Options
-------

  -h, --help
         Print a help message and exit.

  -r, --rna
         Specifies that the fragments are from potentially-spliced RNA.

  -e, --estdist
         Just estimate the distribution of distances.

  -m M, --mismap=M
         Don't write alignments with mismap probability > M.

  -f BP, --fraglen=BP
         The mean distance in bp.  (With -r, the mean of
         ln[distance].)  If this is not specified, the program will
         estimate it from the alignments.

  -s BP, --sdev=BP
         The standard deviation of distance in bp.  (With -r, the
         standard deviation of ln[distance].)  If this is not
         specified, the program will estimate it from the alignments.

  -d PROB, --disjoint=PROB
         The prior probability that a pair of reads comes from
         disjoint locations (e.g., different chromosomes).  This may
         arise from real differences between the genome and the source
         of the reads, or from errors in obtaining the reads or the
         genome sequence.

  -c CHROM, --circular=CHROM
         Specifies that the chromosome named CHROM is circular.  You
         can use this option more than once (e.g., -c chrM -c chrP).
         As a special case, "." means all chromosomes are circular.
         If this option is not used, "chrM" is assumed to be circular
         (but if it is used, only the specified CHROMs are assumed to
         be circular.)

Tips
----

* To go faster, try gapless alignment (add -j1 to the lastal options).
  Often, this is only minusculely less accurate than gapped alignment.
