maf-convert
===========

This script reads alignments in maf format, and writes them in another
format.  It can write them in these formats: axt, blast, html, psl,
sam, tab.  You can use it like this::

  maf-convert psl my-alignments.maf > my-alignments.psl

It's often convenient to pipe in the input, like this::

  ... | maf-convert psl > my-alignments.psl

The input should be "multiple alignment format" as described in the
UCSC Genome FAQ (not "MIRA assembly format" or any other maf).

This script takes the first (topmost) MAF sequence as the "reference"
/ "subject" / "target", and the second sequence as the "query".

For html: if the input includes probability lines starting with 'p',
then the output will be coloured by column probability.  (To get lines
starting with 'p', run lastal with option -j set to 4 or higher.)

Options
-------

  -h, --help
         Print a help message and exit.

  -p, --protein
         Specify that the alignments are of proteins, rather than
         nucleotides.  This affects psl format only (the first 4
         columns).

  -n, --noheader
         Omit any header lines from the output.  This may be useful if
         you concatenate outputs, e.g. from parallel jobs.

  -d, --dictionary
         Include a dictionary of sequence lengths in the sam header
         section (lines starting with @SQ).  This requires reading the
         input twice, so it must be a real file (not a pipe).  This
         affects sam format only.

  -f DICTFILE, --dictfile=DICTFILE
         Get a sequence dictionary from DICTFILE.  This affects sam
         format only.  You can create a dict file using
         CreateSequenceDictionary (http://picard.sourceforge.net/).

  -r READGROUP, --readgroup=READGROUP
         Specify read group information.  This affects sam format
         only.  Example: -r 'ID:1 PL:ILLUMINA SM:mysample'

  -l CHARS, --linesize=CHARS
         Write CHARS characters per line.  This affects blast and html
         formats only.

Hints for sam/bam
-----------------

* To run fast on multiple CPUs, and get a correct header at the top,
  this may be the least-awkward way.  First, make a header (perhaps by
  using CreateSequenceDictionary).  Then, concatenate the output of a
  command like this::

    parallel-fastq "... | maf-convert -n sam" < q.fastq

* Here is yet another way to get a sequence dictionary, using samtools
  (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/).  Assume the reference sequences
  are in ref.fa.  These commands convert x.sam to y.bam while adding a
  sequence dictionary::

    samtools faidx ref.fa
    samtools view -bt ref.fa.fai x.sam > y.bam

* If a query name ends in "/1" or "/2", maf-convert interprets it as a
  paired sequence.  (This affects sam format only.)  However, it does
  not calculate all of the sam pairing information (because it's hard
  and better done by specialized sam manipulators).

  Fix the pair information in y.sam, putting the output in z.bam.
  Using picard::

    java -jar FixMateInformation.jar I=y.sam O=z.bam VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=SILENT

  Alternatively, using samtools::

    samtools sort -n y.bam ysorted
    samtools fixmate ysorted.bam z.bam

"Bugs"
------

* For sam: the QUAL field (column 11) is simply copied from the maf q
  line.  The QUAL is supposed to be encoded as ASCII(phred+33),
  whereas maf q lines are encoded differently according to the UCSC
  Genome FAQ.  However, if you run lastal with option -Q1, the maf q
  lines will in fact be ASCII(phred+33).

* The blast format is merely blast-like: it is not identical to NCBI
  BLAST.
