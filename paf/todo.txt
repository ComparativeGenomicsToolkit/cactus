This set of changes will bring about the following:
    - the removal of self alignments, which are probably mostly unnecessary and expensive, saving around 25% in alignment time
    - the ability to plug either minimap2 or lastz for alignment, in the future it should be easy to add others
    - the ability to align a set of phased genomes to a reference, with an outgroup (proto-pangenome pipeline)
    - the addition of chaining to better determine synteny in complex regions
