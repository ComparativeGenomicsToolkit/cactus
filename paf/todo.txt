This set of changes will bring about the following:
    - the removal of self alignments, which are probably mostly unnecessary and expensive, saving around 25% in alignment time
    - the ability to plug either minimap2 or lastz for alignment, in the future it should be easy to add others
    - the ability to align a set of phased genomes to a reference, with an outgroup (proto-pangenome pipeline)
    - the addition of chaining to better determine synteny in complex regions

- Cleanup paf_consistency and park it.

- Come up with a pipeline for filtering outgroup sequences
  - paf_to_bed: creates a bed coverage track
  - fasta_extract: filter sequences to just those overlapping (or not overlapping) the bed intervals

  - algorithm sketch:
     - construct the paf of all alignments X as follows:
         - for each ingroup A
               - for each outgroup B, ranked in preference (probably closest to furthest)
                    - align A to B to produce pafs Y
                    - identify all ingroup sub-sequences that are unaligned longer than k as follows:
                        - run paf_to_bed on ingroup A with the alignments Y to B to create a bed of aligned coverage on A (consider doing chaining before this is done)
                        - run bed_filter to extract unaligned sequences longer than k creating a reduced subset of A called A'
                    - replace A with A'
                    - if not the first outgroup in list of outgroups:
                        - run paf_dechunk to update the paf coordinates of paf alignments Y to be in the global coordinate space and add them to X

     - extract just the relevant parts of each outgroup to include in the final alignment as follows:
          - for each outgroup B
               - run paf_to_bed on B with X to create a bed of aligned coverage on B
               - run bed_filter to extract aligned sequences
